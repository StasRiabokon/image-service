#  Picture service
Simple picture sharing service (Homework for prog.kiev.ua)

## How To Use
In order to use an application open `src/main/resources/props.properties`. Then set database properties such as `dbUrl`,
`dbUserName`, `dbPassword` to create connection with the database. Also, if you want to send zipped images via email set
mail properties such as `user`(your email), `pass`(your password).
